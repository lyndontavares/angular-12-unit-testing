  /*
    (1) We wrap our test spec function in another function called async.
    (2) We place the tests we need to run after the isAuthenticated promise resolves inside this function.

    This async function executes the code inside its body in a special async test zone. This intercepts and keeps track of all promises created in its body.

    Only when all of those pending promises have been resolved does it then resolves the promise returned from whenStable.

    So by using the async and whenStable functions we now donâ€™t need to use the Jasmine spy mechanism of detecting when the isAuthenticated promise has been resolved, like the previous example.

    This mechanism is slightly better than using the plain Jasmine solution but there is another version which gives us fine grained control and also allows us to lay out our test code as if it were synchronous.

  /*
    (1) Like async we wrap the test spec function in a function called fakeAsync.
    (2) We call tick() when there are pending asynchronous activities we want to complete.

    Like the async function the fakeAsync function executes the code inside its body in a special fake async test zone. This intercepts and keeps track of all promises created in its body.

    The tick() function blocks execution and simulates the passage of time until all pending asynchronous activities complete.

    So when we call tick() the application sits and waits for the promise returned from isAuthenticated to be resolved and then lets execution move to the next line.

    The code above is now layed our linearly, as if we were executing synchronous code, there are no callbacks to confuse the mind and everything is simpler to understand.
